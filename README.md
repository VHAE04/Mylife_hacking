# I hacked everything in school from middle school to high school....

***This is a summary article, not an in-depth analysis.***

```If I edit something, i'll be a best student or i'll be the evil and equal really exist ?```

## Middle school.

Going back in time when I was a middle school kid when I was still practicing playing bangbang game on zinhme with a little knowledge of hacking.

On a beautiful day, my friend invited me to the library to read a book, I saw in the library there is a computer for students and teachers to use public about once or twice I used the computer, I checked the history and saw the teacher. Go to the website to enter grades for students as well as send messages to students who have not studied (to be honest at that time, I was very cayyyyyyyy because I often received messages that I did not my homework T_T)

I know the website is [XXX] and the teacher accidentally saved his account and password on the web
With the account shown as (name of the teacher who taught me)
And the password is hidden as *********

![]()

And with a little F12 knowledge, I opened the command panel and changed type="password" to type="text" to read the password and be able to access my teacher account.

But the special thing is that the teacher's account has less privileges than the school or administrator's account but by accessing my teacher account I got more clues about the other accounts as well as admin accounts, I was going to try all the related passwords as well as easy passwords to hack into those accounts (I later learned it was bruteforce technique) somehow I have hacked 2 admin accounts by the above technique and here are the features and admin accounts. well

Here I have full rights to edit the scores of sending mass messages to parents student teacher information ....

After that, I emailed my teacher about her account being exposed and I was suddenly invited to the principal's room to have a drink and was reminded of the hacking behavior by in the middle of the lesson ._. although I'm trying to make schools safer.


## High school.

At the beginning of 11th grade I knew my school managed grades through an app XXX and when everyone was initially given an account  is the phone number and the password was a string of 6 random numbers. first in my head thought of bruteforce technique through the app's api right at my homeroom's phone number and continued to attack the app's api to get all the information of all the teachers as well as the most privileged principal.

i also learned about web site vulnerabilities and played some ctf.
My school website is created on nukeviet platform and this is also the first time I create a poc about the zero-day xss stored vulnerability about nukeviet and exploit it to take control of my school website (because the article is quite long, i'll make another posts that analyzes this zero-day vulnerability).

ps : you can go to thptvietnambalan-hanoi.edu.vn scroll down to the bottom and press ctrl+a to see secret at the bottom of the web


....Will write more about attacking local computers as well as routers, camera...
